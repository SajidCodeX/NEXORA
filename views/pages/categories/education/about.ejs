            <h2>What is this Service?</h2>
            <p>
                The Grade Report Parser Service is a powerful web tool that allows educational institutions or students to upload grade report PDFs or images and automatically extract key details such as student name, enrollment number, course information, grades, and overall performance metrics (like SGPA and CGPA).
                This service ensures that the extracted data is structured in a clean, standardized JSON format, making it easy to store, analyze, or integrate with other systems.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The process starts when a user uploads their grade report (PDF or image). Our service uses advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract the text from the document. The extracted text is then parsed using custom algorithms that identify and structure the relevant data, such as student information, course-wise grades, and semester performance.
                The final output is a structured JSON file that can be easily used for further processing, analysis, or integration with other systems.

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>
                Our service is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, with EJS for dynamic templating. The OCR process is powered by Tesseract.js, which enables the extraction of text from images and PDFs. The parsing logic is custom-built to ensure high accuracy and data integrity in the final JSON output.
