            <p>
                NEXORA is an advanced document parsing service that allows you to efficiently extract structured data from a wide variety of document formats. Whether you are working with scanned images, PDFs, or other file types, NEXORA ensures that key information such as names, addresses, figures, and other relevant data points are automatically recognized and converted into machine-readable formats like JSON or CSV.
            </p>
            <p>
                NEXORA uses Tabula, a powerful open-source tool, for extracting tabular data from PDFs. Tabula helps ensure that data from documents is captured accurately, especially from scanned documents with complex layouts. This enables seamless parsing and data extraction, saving valuable time and effort.
